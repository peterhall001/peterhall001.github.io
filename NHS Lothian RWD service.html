<p>Real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) are playing an increasing role in health care decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulators use RWD and RWE to monitor post-market safety and adverse events and to make licensing decisions.</li>
<li>The NHS is RWE to support adoption decisions and to develop guidelines and decision support tools for use in clinical practice.</li>
<li>Medical technology developers are using RWD and RWE to support clinical trial designs (e.g., large simple trials, pragmatic clinical trials) and observational studies to generate innovative, new treatment approaches</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-the-nhs-lothian-real-world-data-analytical-service">What is the NHS Lothian Real World Data Analytical Service?</h3>
<p>NHS Lothian has developed a Real World Data Analytical Service that will work with public sector or commercial partners to specify and conduct analysis of routine datasets held by the NHS Lothian Research Safe Haven team and the Edinburgh Cancer Information Programme that can be analysed under the jurisdiction of Caldicott Guardian approval.</p>

<ol>
<li>Complete a first draft of the RWD analysis request form. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8mi12z093lcyven/RWD_analysis_request_v1-0.docx?dl=0">Download the form</a></li>
<li>Discuss with the team - this is an interative process to build a data specification, analysis plan and reporting template.</li>
<li>A quote will be provided with an anticipated delivery time-frame.</li>
<li>The analysis is conducted in dialogue with the requester. The requester will not have access to patient data, but will be able to see aggregate non-identifiable draft outputs and input to the design of a final report.</li>
<li>A final report is produced as the product of collaborative working and are published in the public domain for use as part of an evidence based technology development and adoption process.</li>
